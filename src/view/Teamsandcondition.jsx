              anonymized once the personal data is no longer required to be
              retained for the said purpose. For the avoidance of doubt, when
              you are provided with personal data of a User via the Platform for
              the purposes of obtaining prior confirmation to amend an order
              placed, you shall only use the personal data provided for that
              sole purpose and remove it as soon as you no longer need the data
              for that purpose.
